- Track overall sales and profit trends over time.
- Analyze sales distribution across states, cities, and regions.
- Identify top-performing product categories and sub-categories based on revenue and profit.
- Evaluate segment-wise contribution (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).
- Compare quarterly and yearly sales growth to identify seasonal trends.
This project aims to support data-driven decision-making by offering valuable insights for sales optimization and strategic planning.
